Course Title: Introduction to Database Programming with T-SQL for Beginners 

Course Description: 

This digital course is designed for absolute beginners with zero programming experience who want to learn the fundamentals of database programming using Transact-SQL (T-SQL). T-SQL is a powerful language used for managing and querying relational databases like Microsoft SQL Server. By the end of this course, you will have the foundational skills to work with databases, write T-SQL queries, and understand the basics of database design.
